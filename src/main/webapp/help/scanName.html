Qualys requires scan names to be unique. To make this scan name unique, this plugin will always append execution time to this scan name.<br /> <br />

Additionally, <br />
 - To add your Jenkins job name in the scan name, please add "[job_name]" (without double quotes). <br />
 - To add your Jenkins build number in the scan name, please add "[build_number]" (without double quotes).
